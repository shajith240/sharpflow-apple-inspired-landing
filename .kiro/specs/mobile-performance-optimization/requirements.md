# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The website is experiencing severe performance issues on mobile devices, causing lag and browser crashes. The interactive components (audio visualizer with 1200 particles and ballpit with 150 spheres) are too resource-intensive for mobile devices. This feature will implement comprehensive mobile performance optimizations to ensure smooth operation across all devices without compromising the visual experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the website to load and run smoothly without lag or crashes, so that I can have a seamless browsing experience on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website on a mobile device THEN the page SHALL load within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user interacts with the website on mobile THEN the frame rate SHALL maintain at least 30fps consistently
3. WHEN a user browses the website on mobile THEN the browser SHALL NOT crash or become unresponsive
4. WHEN a user scrolls through the website on mobile THEN the scrolling SHALL be smooth without stuttering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interactive components to be optimized for my device, so that they provide visual appeal without overwhelming my device's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audio visualizer loads on mobile THEN it SHALL use a reduced particle count appropriate for mobile performance
2. WHEN the ballpit component loads on mobile THEN it SHALL use fewer spheres and optimized physics calculations
3. WHEN interactive components detect mobile devices THEN they SHALL automatically adjust quality settings for optimal performance
4. WHEN components are running on mobile THEN they SHALL monitor performance and dynamically adjust if needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the website to be responsive to different screen sizes and device capabilities, so that the experience is tailored to my specific device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website detects a low-end mobile device THEN it SHALL reduce animation complexity automatically
2. WHEN the website runs on devices with limited memory THEN it SHALL use memory-efficient rendering techniques
3. WHEN the website detects high pixel density screens THEN it SHALL optimize canvas rendering for the device pixel ratio
4. WHEN the website runs on devices with limited GPU capabilities THEN it SHALL fallback to simpler rendering methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and optimization tools, so that I can ensure the website maintains good performance across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality settings
2. WHEN components are initialized THEN they SHALL detect device capabilities and set appropriate performance levels
3. WHEN the website runs in production THEN it SHALL include performance monitoring for mobile devices
4. WHEN performance optimizations are applied THEN they SHALL maintain the visual integrity of the design
