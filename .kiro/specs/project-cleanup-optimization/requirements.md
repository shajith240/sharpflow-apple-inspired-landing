# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up the current React/TypeScript project by removing unused code and files, followed by implementing advanced production features including CI/CD pipelines for Vercel deployment with custom domain support. The goal is to optimize the project structure, improve maintainability, and establish a robust deployment pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove all unused files and code from my project, so that I can maintain a clean and efficient codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup process runs THEN the system SHALL identify all unused files in the project
2. WHEN unused files are identified THEN the system SHALL safely remove files that are not referenced anywhere
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL preserve all files that are actively used by the application
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of removed files and space saved
5. IF a file has uncertain usage THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review rather than auto-delete

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused code within files, so that I can reduce bundle size and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code files THEN the system SHALL identify unused imports, functions, and variables
2. WHEN unused code is found THEN the system SHALL remove unused imports automatically
3. WHEN removing code THEN the system SHALL preserve all code that is referenced or exported
4. WHEN code cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all remaining code is functional
5. IF code removal might break functionality THEN the system SHALL require manual confirmation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize my project dependencies, so that I can reduce bundle size and improve build performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify unused packages in package.json
2. WHEN unused dependencies are found THEN the system SHALL remove them from package.json
3. WHEN dependencies are removed THEN the system SHALL update lock files accordingly
4. WHEN dependency cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the application still builds successfully
5. IF a dependency removal causes build errors THEN the system SHALL restore the dependency and flag for review

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up CI/CD pipelines for Vercel deployment, so that I can automate my deployment process with custom domain support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up CI/CD THEN the system SHALL create GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment
2. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger build and deployment
3. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL deploy to Vercel with custom domain configuration
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options
5. IF tests exist THEN the system SHALL run all tests before deployment and block deployment on test failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure production optimizations, so that my website performs optimally in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL enable all performance optimizations
2. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching strategies
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate optimized bundles with code splitting
4. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL serve assets with appropriate headers for performance
5. IF performance metrics are below threshold THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish proper environment configuration, so that I can manage different deployment environments effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring environments THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production environments
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL provide secure configuration management
3. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate configuration for each environment
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
5. IF environment configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and show clear error messages
