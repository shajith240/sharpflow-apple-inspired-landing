# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create shared touch utilities for reusable touch handling



  - Create a utility module for touch event handling and coordinate conversion
  - Implement touch position calculation functions that work across different screen sizes
  - Add touch state management utilities for tracking active touches
  - Write unit tests for touch utility functions



  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 2. Add touch support to the audio visualizer component
  - Add touch event listeners (touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel) to the canvas element
  - Implement touch position mapping from touch coordinates to canvas-relative positions
  - Integrate touch state with existing mouse interaction logic in the updateParticle function
  - Add touch-specific behavior for particle rotation and interaction
  - Prevent default touch behaviors that interfere with component interaction
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 3. Add touch support to the ballpit component
  - Extend the existing pointer system in the ballpit component to handle touch events
  - Add touch event listeners to the canvas element in the createBallpit function
  - Implement touch coordinate normalization for the raycasting system
  - Integrate touch state management with the existing pointer data structure
  - Add touch-specific behavior for sphere attraction and physics interactions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement performance optimizations for touch interactions
  - Add touch event throttling to maintain 60fps performance during rapid touch movements
  - Implement coordinate caching to reduce computation overhead
  - Add passive event listeners where appropriate for better scroll performance
  - Optimize touch coordinate calculations for mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Add proper event cleanup and memory management
  - Ensure all touch event listeners are properly removed on component unmount
  - Add cleanup for touch-related state and resources
  - Implement proper error handling for touch event failures
  - Add memory leak prevention for touch event handlers
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Test touch functionality across different scenarios
  - Write automated tests for touch event handling and coordinate conversion
  - Test multi-touch scenarios to ensure primary touch point handling
  - Verify seamless switching between mouse and touch input methods
  - Test touch interactions on different screen sizes and orientations
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 1.4, 2.4_
