# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The website's interactive components (audio visualizer and ballpit) currently only respond to mouse cursor interactions and do not work properly on mobile touch devices. Users on mobile devices cannot interact with these components using finger touches, which significantly degrades the user experience on mobile platforms. This feature will add comprehensive touch support to make these interactive components fully responsive to finger touches on mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the audio visualizer to respond to my finger touches, so that I can interact with the spherical particle system on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user touches the audio visualizer on a mobile device THEN the particle system SHALL respond to the touch position
2. WHEN a user moves their finger across the audio visualizer THEN the particles SHALL follow the finger movement with the same responsiveness as mouse cursor
3. WHEN a user lifts their finger from the audio visualizer THEN the particles SHALL return to their default behavior (auto-rotation)
4. WHEN a user performs multi-touch gestures THEN the system SHALL handle the primary touch point for interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the ballpit component to respond to my finger touches, so that I can interact with the 3D spheres using touch gestures on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user touches the ballpit component on a mobile device THEN the spheres SHALL be attracted to the touch position
2. WHEN a user moves their finger across the ballpit THEN the spheres SHALL follow the finger movement with physics-based interactions
3. WHEN a user lifts their finger from the ballpit THEN the spheres SHALL return to their natural physics behavior
4. WHEN a user performs multi-touch gestures THEN the system SHALL handle the primary touch point for sphere attraction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want smooth and responsive touch interactions, so that the interactive components feel natural and performant on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with touch-enabled components THEN the touch response SHALL have minimal latency (under 16ms)
2. WHEN a user performs rapid touch movements THEN the components SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance
3. WHEN a user switches between touch and mouse input THEN the components SHALL seamlessly handle both input methods
4. WHEN a user uses the components on different mobile devices THEN the touch interactions SHALL work consistently across iOS and Android

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the touch implementation to be maintainable and reusable, so that future interactive components can easily support both mouse and touch interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing touch support THEN the code SHALL maintain separation between mouse and touch event handling
2. WHEN adding touch events THEN the existing mouse functionality SHALL remain unchanged and functional
3. WHEN touch events are added THEN the implementation SHALL prevent default touch behaviors that interfere with component interaction
4. WHEN touch support is implemented THEN the code SHALL include proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks
