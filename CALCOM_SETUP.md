# Cal.com Integration Setup Guide

Your website is now configured to use Cal.com for consultation bookings! Follow these steps to complete the setup.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Cal.com Account
1. Go to [cal.com/signup](https://cal.com/signup)
2. Sign up for a free account

### Step 2: Connect Your Calendar
1. In Cal.com, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Connected Calendars**
2. Connect your Google Calendar, Outlook, or other calendar service

### Step 3: Create Your Event Type
1. Go to **Event Types** in your Cal.com dashboard
2. Create a new event type with these settings:
   - **Name**: "Free Consultation"
   - **URL**: `consultation` (this creates `/consultation` endpoint)
   - **Duration**: 30 minutes (or your preferred length)
   - **Buffer Time**: 15 minutes before/after
   - **Location**: Google Meet, Zoom, or Phone
   - **Description**: Add details about what the consultation covers

### Step 4: Update Your Website Configuration
1. Open `src/config/booking.ts`
2. Replace `"your-username"` with your actual Cal.com username
3. Replace `"contact@sharpflow.com"` with your actual email

```typescript
export const BOOKING_CONFIG = {
  calcomUsername: "your-actual-username", // ‚Üê Update this
  contactEmail: "your-email@domain.com",  // ‚Üê Update this
  // ... rest of config
}
```
